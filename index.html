    <p>The shoebill, a striking bird native to East Africa, boasts a massive, shoe-shaped bill, standing tall at 4.5 to 5 feet with a wingspan of 7 to 8 feet. Preferring freshwater marshes and wetlands, it employs its precise striking ability to catch fish, its primary diet. Despite its impressive stature, the shoebill is vulnerable due to habitat loss and human disturbance.
